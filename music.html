title: Help us pick music
---

<p>Emily and Ritchie both certainly have their own musical tastes, and we also have a sense of what it means for a song to be "crowd-pleasing." But we think that the best way to make sure everyone gets to hear music that they like is for everybody to add their own beloved tracks to the mix. So, we've created a collaborative playlist on Spotify that we'll be playing after dinner, while people are dancing and hanging out.</p>

<p>You can access the playlist by clicking <a class="inline-link" href="http://open.spotify.com/user/1230502294/playlist/0Lox2Ry3Gu5fjedqjThK4D">this link</a>. You'll need to <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/" class="inline-link">have a Spotify account</a> before you can contribute â€“ but don't worry, you can create one for free. If you run into any technical problems, just shoot Ritchie an email at <a href="mailto:RitchieSKing@gmail.com" class="inline-link">RitchieSKing@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p>(Certainly don't feel obligated to add your own songs. We have more than enough favorites to fill up the night. But if there's music you want to contribute, we'd be delighted if you did.)</p>

<p>Here's an emdedded version of the playlist, so you can see what's on there so far (and listen if you want!):</p>
