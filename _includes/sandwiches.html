<p class="first-sandwich-graf">The wedding will be catered by <a href="http://www.zingermansdeli.com/" class="inline-link">Zingerman's</a>, an Ann Arbor institution that is famous for its delicious deli sandwiches. President Obama <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/02/obama-zingermans-reuben_n_5078863.html" class="inline-link">recently described</a> their rueben as "killer," and Food & Wine has named it one of the best sandwiches in the country.</p>

<p>We're going to offer three different Zingerman's sandwiches for dinner, and we need to know which one you'd like.</p>

<p>The first is called "Sherman's Sure Choice." It's a slight twist on the classic reuben, with coleslaw instead of sauerkraut.</p>
