title: Give us presents
---
<p>As far as we're concerned, seeing you at our wedding is enough of a present. But if you'd like to get us something in addition, there are two options.</p>

<p>We are going to Thailand (we hope!*) for our honeymoon, and we've set up a honeymoon fund. If you'd like to give us a gift, how about a cooking class in Bangkok or a train ride to Chiang Mai? <a class="inline-link" href="http://www.honeyfund.com/wedding/emilyandritchie">Link to Honeyfund site</a></p>

<p>We have also set up a gift registry with some kitchenware and the like for those of you who would rather give us a physical present. <a class="inline-link" href="http://www.amazon.com/registry/wedding/2XYXK7VL1TUGC

<p>*There is a military coup happening in Thailand right now, so we might have to change our plans. In any event, we are going to go on a honeymoon, and any honeyfund money we receive will go towards that trip.</p>
