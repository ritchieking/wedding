title: Give us presents
---
<p>Emily and Ritchie are going to Thailand for their honeymoon, and we are setting up a honeymoon fund. If you'd like to give us a gift, how about a cooking class in Bangkok or a train ride to Chiang Mai?</p>

<p>We have also set up a gift registry with some kitchenware and the like for those of you who would rather give us a physical present.
