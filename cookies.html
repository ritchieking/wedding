title: Add to the cookie table
---

<p>Inspired by the wedding reception of our dear friends, Jill and Ad Yeomans, we are going to have a cookie table instead of a wedding cake. What's a cookie table? It's where we call on the bakers in our guest list to bring a few batches of those awesome secret-recipe cookies that they are always showing off at parties. We'll lay all the cookies out on a table in a glorious spread and we'll all dig in after dinner.</p>

<p>If you'd like to contribute some cookies, get in touch with Ritchie's sister, Becci Dean, at <a class="inline-link" href="mailto:Becci.Dean@gmail.com">Becci.Dean@gmail.com</a>. We will all love you for it.</p>
