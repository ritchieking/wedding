	<p>The elegant and effusive Mrs. Linda Elert and the brilliant and steadfast Mr. James Elert request the honor of your presence to bear witness to the union of their daughter,</p>

<h1>Emily Barbara Elert</h1>

<p>to</p>

<h1>Ritchie Sutherland King</h1>

<p>son of the eminently lovely Mrs. Virginia Natter and that exemplar of southern charm, Mr. William Natter, II.</p>

<p class="detail-text">Saturday June the Fourteenth, Two Thousand Fourteen, 5:30 Post Meridiem</p>

<p class="detail-text">830 Avon Rd. Ann Arbor, MI</p>

<p>It is to be a resplendent celebration of the time-honored nuptial rite, a day replete with all worldly good and lightness. Will it be a delightful time? Oh certainly!</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the ceremony, all are invited to partake of local culinary offerings of the highest order. Imbibing, embracing, embarrassing oneself on the dance floor, and all the variegated forms of joyous love expression will be instigated, encouraged, and, above all, appreciated.</p>

<p>We hope to see you there!</p>
